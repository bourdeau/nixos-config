# GTK

This system uses **Home Manager** to configure GTK theming consistently across
GTK3 and GTK4 applications such as **Thunar**.

## Current Setup

We use the **Adwaita-dark** theme, which is part of the upstream GTK
distribution. It is stable, maintained, and guaranteed to work correctly with
GTK updates.
